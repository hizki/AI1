class Node:
    '''
    A node in a search tree used by the various graph search algorithms.
    Contains a pointer to the parent (the node that this is a successor of) and
    to the actual state for this node. Note that if a state is arrived at by
    two paths, then there are two nodes with the same state.
    Also includes the action that got us to this state, and the total path_cost
    (also known as g) to reach the node.
    Other functions may add an f and h value; see BestFirstGraphSearch and
    AStar for an explanation of how the f and h values are handled.

        create an empty container.
